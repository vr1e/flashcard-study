**Tips for writing ADRs:**
- Make the Decision statement crystal clear
- Focus on the "why" - context is the most important section
- Be honest about tradeoffs - every decision has downsides
- Keep it short - if you can't explain it in one page, simplify
- Write it when you make the decision, not weeks later
